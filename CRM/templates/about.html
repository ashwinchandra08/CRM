    <h2 class="text-center text-danger">About Our Customer Relationship Management DBMS Mini Project</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) DBMS Mini Project! This project is designed to showcase
        the implementation of a simple yet effective CRM system using a relational database management system (DBMS).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Objective:</strong> The primary goal of our project is to provide a platform for managing customer
        information, product details, and transactions efficiently. This system helps businesses keep track of their
        customers, products, and related transactions, facilitating better customer relationship management.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Features:</strong> Our CRM system includes features such as adding new customers, managing product
        details, recording transactions, and ensuring data integrity through the use of triggers in the database.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> The project is implemented using Flask, a web framework for Python, and
        integrates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve data. We have utilized Flask-SQLAlchemy for seamless
        database interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        We hope you find our CRM DBMS Mini Project informative and valuable. Thank you for exploring our work!
